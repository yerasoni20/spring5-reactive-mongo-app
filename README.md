# spring5-reactive-mongo-recipe-app
Reactive Recipe Application Using MongoDB

This repository is for an example application built in my Spring Framework 5. This application shows the food recipe app using reactive programming using MongoDB.

Reactive Programming is a style of micro-architecture involving intelligent routing and consumption of events, all combining to change behaviour.

This application demonstrates the concepts of converting the repositories to reactive, refactoring ingredient service and image service to reactive programming, changing the service layer to reactive.
